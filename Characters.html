                           Thousands of years ago, the Giants fought battles in Skylands but were banished to Earth. With a new threat looming, they are summoned back to join forces with the Skylanders. After the events of Spyro's Adventure, on Earth, a toy store called Super Toy Planet has just closed shop for the day. Amongst the toys stood the frozen toy form of Kaos, who was recovered and placed inside the toy store. He soon breaks free of his toy prison due to his status as a Portal Master, and recalls Master Eon and the Skylanders banishing him to Earth. Kaos then discovers five of the Skylanders (Spyro, Stealth Elf, Gill Grunt, Eruptor, and Stump Smash) frozen in toy form inside a plastic display, and he proceeds to taunt them while the Skylanders could do nothing but make idle threats to the evil Portal Master. Kaos is soon contacted by his butler, Glumshanks, who has been looking everywhere for Kaos since his exile. Seeing a nearby Portal of Power, Kaos uses it to return to Skylands, ignoring the warnings of Glumshanks that Portal Masters are not supposed to use the portal on themselves...

                            Portal Masters embark on an all-new adventure in the mysterious Cloudbreak Islands, home to a mystical volcano that erupts every hundred years to replenish the magic in Skylands. During an epic battle, a brave group of Skylanders were caught in the volcano's eruption, which blasted them apart and sent them to earth. But, the magic of the volcano gave these heroes a remarkable new power — the ability to swap halves — turning them into a special team known as the SWAP Force. Meanwhile, Kaos is back with a new evil plan. And now, Portal Masters everywhere must reassemble the SWAP Force — in their original form or in new combinations — and send them back to Cloudbreak to save Skylands!

Using Traptanium, a magic material that can harness the power of the Elements, you have the amazing ability to trap the villains and return them to Skylands to fight for you!

                            The story of Skylanders Imaginators takes place long ago when the Ancients used a mysterious power known as Mind Magic to create everything in Skylands. With it, they conjured into existence anything that they could imagine. However, they soon learned that in the wrong hands, it could be very dangerous, and so they sealed it away so that it could never be misused. After discovering this ancient secret, the evil Portal Master Kaos has unleashed the power of Mind Magic into Skylands once again - and he is using it to create an unstoppable army of Doomlanders, the likes of which have never been seen! Now it's up to Portal Masters and, to help train them, the greatest mystic warriors of all time - the Senseis, to create Skylanders Imaginators from their own imagination to stop Kaos and his Doomlanders before it is too late.
