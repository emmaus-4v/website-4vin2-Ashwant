                            "Greetings, young Portal Master, I have been waiting for you. I am Eon, your guide in this world." -Master Eon. Master Eon, also known as Eon, is a veteran Portal Master who is one of the main supporting characters in the Skylanders series. He was the leader of the Skylanders before he became a spirit, and passed his role to the new Portal Master, who is the player. Eon is known as the greatest among the Portal Masters. He has great knowledge over the history and realms of Skylands, and has utmost faith in his Skylanders and the new Portal Master. He has a crippling fear of falcons, but allows the Air Sensei Air Strike to keep his Zephyr Falcon, Birdie.

                            "BOOM!" -Flynn's catchphrase. Flynn is a Mabu pilot who is one of the main supporting characters in the Skylanders series. Calling himself the "best pilot in all of Skylands", he is armed with a big ego and a love for enchiladas. He has a crush on another Mabu named Cali. Flynn is notable for his very over-confident personality, especially when it comes to "the ladies". He often calls himself 'the greatest pilot in all of Skylands'. He also tends to put himself in the spotlight, often taking credit for things the Skylander does. In addition, Flynn can be accident-prone and silly while adventuring with the Skylanders.

                            "So you're ready to try a Heroic Challenge huh? Well, let me warn you right off the bat, they're TOUGH. Like me. Want to give one a try?" -Cali. Cali is a Mabu adventurer and one of the main supporting characters in the Skylanders series. After you rescue her in Perilous Pastures, she will offer you Heroic Challenges for each Skylander. Cali is one of Skylands' most daring explorers. She describes herself as being tough and laughs in the face of danger. She's shown to be rather smart and quick to make the right decisions in perilous situations, but she is also shown to have a very caring and even somewhat motherly side to her. She is never afraid of being captured by her enemies, which is lucky as it seems to happen quite a lot.[1] Despite this, as revealed in Prism Break and Sunburn's Heroic Challenges, she hates spiders. If you're looking for adventure, Cali is the natural choice as a trainer to prepare young Skylanders for future missions.

                            Hugo is a Mabu who is Master Eon's assistant. He doesn't has a catchphrase or something. He is one of the main supporting characters in the series. He made his debut in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure, using the Far-Viewer to help the Skylanders collect the Eternal Sources needed to repair the Core of Light. Hugo is well educated and is often found reading a book or doing research. He can be a bit negative at times, and quick to despair, but he will snap out of it and do what he thinks is necessary when things go wrong. He also has a strong dislike for sheep and tries to convince others to distrust them on many occasions.

                            "Oh, you didn't really think Kaos was the strongest Portal Master on the side of darkness, did you?" -Kaossandra. Kaossandra, usually refered to as Kaos' Mom, is the mother of Kaos and an antagonist in the Skylanders series. She never made a full appearance until Skylanders: Giants where she appeared in a family photo inside Kaos' Kastle. Later her silhouette briefly appeared in the end after the credits shortly after Kaos returned from being defeated by the Skylanders. Kaossandra makes her full debut in Skylanders: Swap Force as an evil Portal Master like her son.

                            "Okay. Pull yourself together, Glumshanks. You can do this! You're evil enough now! You wanna go back to washing Kaos' dirty socks?! This is it! This. Is. Your. Shot!" -Glumshanks. Glumshanks is Kaos's right hand henchman, butler, and only friend. He is taller, more sensible, and slightly physically stronger than Kaos, but still serves him. He is a recurring antagonist in the series, though occasionally he has a neutral or even helpful role. Glumshanks is Kaos's sidekick and butler. He has always been loyal and faithful to Kaos, even though he is often in despair over his hair-brained plans and terrible jokes.[1] He is often shown to be the more down-to-earth foil to Kaos' over the top ambitions. Glumshanks seems to have a low self-esteem, being more reasonable and careful of his actions, and less evil, much to Kaos' dismay. In Skylanders: SuperChargers, he appears to have a humble side, always attempting to repay others' kindness even at the cost of his own safety.
